CSGrad4US Fellowship Application (https://etap.nsf.gov/award/1059/opportunity/1192)

The National Science Foundation (NSF) Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Directorate recently announced that applications are now being accepted for the third year of the CSGrad4US (https://www.nsf.gov/cise/CSGrad4US/) Graduate Fellowship program. The 3-year fellowships support new Ph.D. students pursuing their degree in a CISE field which includes programs in Computer Science, Computer and Information Sciences, and Computer Engineering.

This program has already changed the lives of 78 people, with 16 participants from Cohort 1 now attending CISE PhD programs and 62 participants from Cohort 2 receiving admissions offers from PhD programs this spring!

Goal and Motivation

The goal is to increase the number of diverse, domestic graduate students pursuing research and innovation careers in the CISE fields. The fellowship program, which will provide 3-year fellowship opportunities for new Ph.D. students in the computing disciplines, was released in response to the increased demand for people with a Ph.D. in CISE fields, the continued decrease of domestic students pursuing research and completing a Ph.D., and the overall small number of bachelor’s degree recipients in CS pursuing graduate school. In particular, the percentage of domestic Ph.D. students in Computer Science graduating has decreased from 69% in 1985 to 31% in 2021 [1].

NSF seeks candidates from a broad array of backgrounds and strongly encourages women, African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, Native Pacific Islanders, and persons with disabilities to apply.

Cost-of-education allowance of $16,000 per year for the three years noted above to the institution of higher education, which typically covers costs for all tuition, medical insurance, and institutional fees.
